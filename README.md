## Reflection
- One of the points about which I'm very happy how it turned out is the sorting and ordering of the addresses because I think I am doing it using a very easy and changable way.
- Another point I'm happy about is the structure of the project, everything is well seperated into layerns and communication between the layers is clear and clean.
- A point I'm less happy about is the structure, i have ended up puttin all of my endpoints within the program.cs file. I tried to use a seperate controller file but I did not manage to finish that in tI'me.
- Another thing that I did not manage to to was include JSON in my swagger requests, in order to still be able to test the requests I have included a postman collection.
