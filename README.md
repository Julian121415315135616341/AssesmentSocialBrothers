## Reflection
- One of the points about which im very happy how it turned out is the sorting and ordering of the addresses because i think i am doing it using a very easy and changable way.
- Another point im happy about is the structure of the project, everything is well seperated into layerns and communication between the layers is clear and clean.
- A point im less happy about is the structure, i have ended up puttin all of my endpoints within the program.cs file. I tried to use a seperate controller file but i didnt manage to finish that in time.
- Another thing that i did not manage to to was include JSON in my swagger requests, in order to still be able to test the requests i have included a postman collection.
